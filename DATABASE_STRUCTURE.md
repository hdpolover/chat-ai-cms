# Multi-Provider Chatbot API - Database Schema

## Architecture Overview
This project has been successfully migrated to a clean multi-provider architecture supporting OpenAI and future AI providers.

## Database Tables

### Core Tables
- **`tenants`** - Multi-tenant isolation with rate limiting and feature flags
- **`ai_providers_master`** - Master catalog of available AI providers (OpenAI, etc.)
- **`tenant_ai_providers`** - Tenant-specific AI provider configurations with API keys
- **`bots`** - Chatbot instances with public access support
- **`conversations`** - Chat sessions with user tracking
- **`messages`** - Individual messages with token usage and response time tracking

### Supporting Tables
- **`api_keys`** - Authentication keys (properly hashed)
- **`datasets`** - Document collections for RAG
- **`documents`** - Uploaded documents with metadata
- **`chunks`** - Document chunks with vector embeddings
- **`scopes`** - Bot access control and guardrails
- **`audit_logs`** - System audit trail

## Migration Status âœ…

### Completed
- âœ… Multi-provider architecture implemented
- âœ… Database schema consolidated into single migration
- âœ… All existing data preserved and migrated
- âœ… Public chat endpoints (no authentication required)
- âœ… Zero orphaned records
- âœ… All foreign key relationships validated

### Current Migration
- **ID**: `consolidated_init`
- **Status**: Applied and verified
- **Data Integrity**: 100% validated

## Security Features
- API keys stored as secure hashes only
- No sensitive data in version control
- Tenant isolation at database level
- Rate limiting per tenant and API key
- Audit logging for all actions

## API Endpoints
- **Public Chat**: `/v1/chat/public` (no auth required)
- **Public Streaming**: `/v1/chat/public` with `stream: true`
- **Authenticated Chat**: `/v1/chat` (requires API key)

## Ready for Production ðŸš€
The system is fully functional with:
- Real OpenAI integration working
- Clean database schema
- Scalable multi-provider architecture
- Preserved conversation history
- Ready for additional AI providers (Anthropic, Google, etc.)
