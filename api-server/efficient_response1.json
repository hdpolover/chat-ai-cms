Let's first try factoring:\n\nWe are looking for two numbers that multiply to \\(6\\) (coefficient of the constant term) and add up to \\(-5\\) (coefficient of the linear term). These numbers are \\(-2\\) and \\(-3\\).\n\nSo, we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[x^2 - 2x - 3x + 6 = 0\\]\nFactor by grouping:\n\\[x(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0\\]\n\\[(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0\\]\n\nNow, we have two factors that multiply to zero. This means either \\(x - 2 = 0\\) or \\(x - 3 = 0\\).\n\nSolving these equations gives us:\n\\[x = 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 3\\]\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\)."},"citations":[],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":261,"completion_tokens":255,"total_tokens":516},"metadata":{"source":"efficient_test"}}
