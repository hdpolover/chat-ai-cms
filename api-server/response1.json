{"session_id":"7a436e14-f867-4836-9319-6a19b70226d8","message":{"role":"assistant","content":"The quadratic formula is a fundamental formula used to find the solutions to a quadratic equation of the form \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\), where \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants and \\( x \\) is the variable. The quadratic formula states that the solutions for \\( x \\) can be found using the formula:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}} \\]\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how to use the quadratic formula:\n\n1. Identify the coefficients \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) in the quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\).\n2. Substitute the values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) into the quadratic formula.\n3. Calculate the value of the discriminant \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). This value determines the nature of the solutions:\n   - If \\( b^2 - 4ac > 0 \\), there are two distinct real solutions.\n   - If \\( b^2 - 4ac = 0 \\), there is one real solution (a repeated root).\n   - If \\( b^2 - 4ac < 0 \\), there are two complex solutions.\n4. Use the values of \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) along with the discriminant to calculate the solutions for \\( x \\) by substituting them into the formula \\( x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}} \\).\n\nBy applying the quadratic formula correctly, you can find the roots of a quadratic equation efficiently and accurately."},"citations":[],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":249,"completion_tokens":363,"total_tokens":612},"metadata":{"source":"context_test"}}
