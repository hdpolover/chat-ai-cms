Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:\n2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5\n2x = 8\n\n2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:\n2x / 2 = 8 / 2\nx = 4\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation 2x + 5 = 13 is x = 4."},"citations":[],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":261,"completion_tokens":110,"total_tokens":371},"metadata":{"source":"context_test"}}
